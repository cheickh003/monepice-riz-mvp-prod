  sampleRate: 1.0, // 100% error capture
  tracesSampleRate: 0.1, // 10% performance tracking
  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.01 // 1% session replay
}
```

### Alert Configuration

**Critical Alerts** (Immediate Response):
- Payment processing failures >5% in 5 minutes
- Authentication system errors
- Database connection failures
- API gateway errors >50% in 2 minutes

**High Priority Alerts** (Within 1 hour):
- Error rate >10% in 15 minutes

- Third-party service integration failures

**Medium Priority Alerts** (Within 4 hours):
- Unusual error patterns
- Performance regression >20%
- Feature usage anomalies
- Non-critical service warnings

### Data Privacy and Security

1. **Sensitive Data Filtering**
   ```typescript
   // Automatically filtered fields
   - passwords, tokens, api_keys
   - credit card numbers
   - phone numbers (partially masked)
   - email addresses (domain preserved)
   - personal identification data
   ```

2. **GDPR Compliance**
   - Data retention: 90 days for errors, 30 days for performance
   - User data minimization
   - Right to be forgotten implementation
   - Data processing consent management

3. **Geographic Considerations**
   - IP address anonymization for Côte d'Ivoire users
   - French language error messages
   - Local timezone configuration
