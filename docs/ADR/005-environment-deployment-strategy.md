# ADR-005: Environment and Deployment Strategy - Three-Environment Setup

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Deciders**: Development Team, DevOps Team, Business Team  

## Context

MonEpice&Riz requires a robust deployment strategy that ensures reliable e-commerce operations while enabling safe development and testing cycles. The system must handle financial transactions, customer data, and inventory management with zero tolerance for production issues.

## Decision

We chose a **three-environment deployment strategy** with Development, Staging, and Production environments, each with isolated services and data.

## Rationale

### Three-Environment Benefits

1. **Risk Mitigation**
   - **Isolated Testing**: Changes tested in staging before production
   - **Data Protection**: Production data never exposed to development
   - **Rollback Safety**: Multiple checkpoints before customer impact
   - **Service Isolation**: Each environment has separate third-party services

2. **Development Workflow**
   - **Feature Development**: Safe development environment for experimentation
   - **Integration Testing**: Staging environment for end-to-end testing
   - **Quality Assurance**: Production-like testing before release
   - **Performance Testing**: Load testing without production impact

3. **Business Continuity**
   - **Zero-Downtime Deployments**: Blue-green deployment capability
   - **Hotfix Capability**: Rapid production fixes through staging validation
   - **Disaster Recovery**: Multiple environment copies for backup
   - **Customer Protection**: Multiple validation layers prevent issues

4. **Compliance and Security**
   - **Data Segregation**: Separate databases and storage per environment
   - **Access Control**: Role-based environment access
   - **Audit Trails**: Complete deployment and change tracking
   - **Security Testing**: Isolated security validation

    A[Developer Push] --> B[GitHub Actions]
    B --> C[Lint & Test]
    C --> D[Build Application]
    D --> E[Deploy to Development]

```

### Deployment Strategies by Environment

**Development Deployment**:
- **Trigger**: Every push to feature branches
- **Strategy**: Direct deployment
- **Validation**: Automated tests only
- **Rollback**: Not required (development only)

**Staging Deployment**:
- **Trigger**: Merge to main branch
- **Strategy**: Blue-green deployment
- **Validation**: Automated tests + manual QA
- **Rollback**: Automatic on test failure

**Production Deployment**:
- **Trigger**: Manual approval after staging validation
- **Strategy**: Blue-green with canary testing
- **Validation**: Comprehensive health checks
- **Rollback**: Automatic on health check failure

### Database Migration Strategy

1. **Development Phase**
   ```bash
   # Schema changes tested locally
   npm run db:migrate:dev
   npm run db:seed:dev
   ```

2. **Staging Validation**
   ```bash
   # Migration tested with production-like data
   npm run db:migrate:staging
   npm run db:verify:staging
   ```

3. **Production Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Zero-downtime migration with backup
   npm run db:backup:prod
   npm run db:migrate:prod
   npm run db:verify:prod
   ```
