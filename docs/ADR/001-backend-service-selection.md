# ADR-001: Backend Service Selection - Appwrite vs Supabase

**Status**: Accepted  
**Date**: January 2025  
**Deciders**: Development Team  

## Context

MonEpice&Riz needs a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) solution to handle user authentication, database operations, file storage, and real-time features. The primary candidates were Supabase and Appwrite.

## Decision

We chose **Appwrite** as our Backend-as-a-Service provider.

## Rationale

### Appwrite Advantages

1. **Developer Experience**
   - Comprehensive SDKs for all major platforms
   - Built-in TypeScript support with excellent type definitions
   - Intuitive dashboard and project management interface
   - Clear documentation and examples

2. **African Market Considerations**
   - European data centers provide better latency to Côte d'Ivoire
   - Strong focus on developer markets in emerging economies
   - Multi-language support including French interface
   - Pricing models suitable for growing African businesses

3. **Security & Compliance**
   - Built-in security features (encryption at rest and in transit)
   - GDPR compliance out of the box
   - Granular permission system
   - Built-in rate limiting and abuse protection

4. **Feature Completeness**
   - Real-time subscriptions
   - Cloud functions for business logic
   - Built-in storage with image transformation
   - Comprehensive authentication methods
   - Database with complex querying capabilities

5. **Scalability**
   - Auto-scaling infrastructure
   - CDN integration for file delivery
   - Support for multiple environments
   - Database replication and backup

### Supabase Comparison

While Supabase offers excellent PostgreSQL features and has strong developer adoption, Appwrite better suited our specific needs:

- **Geographic Advantage**: Appwrite's European infrastructure provides better performance for West African users
- **Mobile-First**: Appwrite's mobile SDKs are more mature for potential future mobile app development
- **Simplicity**: Less complex setup for typical e-commerce use cases
- **Cost Structure**: More predictable pricing for our anticipated usage patterns

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Multi-Environment Setup**
   - Development: `monepiceriz-dev`
   - Staging: `monepiceriz-staging`
   - Production: `monepiceriz-prod`

2. **Authentication Strategy**
   - Email/password for initial launch
   - Phone authentication for future mobile integration
   - OAuth providers for user convenience

3. **Database Design**
   - Document-based collections for flexibility
   - Proper indexing for performance
   - Real-time subscriptions for live updates

4. **Storage Configuration**
   - Separate buckets for different content types
   - Image optimization and CDN delivery
   - Proper access controls and permissions

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Faster Development**: Rich SDKs and documentation accelerate development
- **Better Performance**: European servers provide optimal latency for our target market
- **Cost Efficiency**: Predictable pricing structure aligned with our business model
- **Feature Rich**: Comprehensive feature set reduces need for additional services
- **Developer Productivity**: Excellent TypeScript support and tooling

### Negative

- **Learning Curve**: Team needs to learn Appwrite-specific patterns and APIs
- **Ecosystem**: Smaller community compared to Supabase
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Migration to other services would require significant refactoring
- **Beta Features**: Some advanced features are still in beta

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Knowledge Building**
   - Comprehensive documentation and training for development team
   - Regular review of Appwrite updates and new features
   - Active participation in Appwrite community

2. **Vendor Lock-in Management**
   - Abstract database operations behind service interfaces
   - Regular data exports and backup procedures
   - Documentation of migration procedures

3. **Performance Monitoring**
   - Implement comprehensive monitoring with Sentry integration
   - Regular performance audits and optimization
   - Load testing before major releases

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Supabase**
   - Excellent PostgreSQL integration
   - Strong SQL capabilities
   - Large community and ecosystem
   - *Rejected*: Geographic latency concerns, more complex setup

2. **Firebase**
   - Google infrastructure and reliability
   - Mature ecosystem and documentation
   - Real-time database capabilities
   - *Rejected*: Higher costs, vendor lock-in concerns, pricing complexity

3. **Custom Backend (Node.js + PostgreSQL)**
   - Full control over architecture and features
   - No vendor lock-in
   - Customizable to exact requirements
   - *Rejected*: Significant development time, infrastructure management overhead

## Success Metrics

- **Performance**: Page load times under 3 seconds for users in Côte d'Ivoire
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for critical e-commerce operations
- **Developer Experience**: Reduced development time for new features by 40%
- **Cost Efficiency**: Backend costs under 15% of total technical budget
- **Scalability**: Support for 10,000+ concurrent users without performance degradation

## Review Schedule

- **Next Review**: Q2 2025 or when reaching 1,000 active users
- **Review Triggers**: 
  - Performance issues affecting user experience
  - Cost structure changes impacting budget
  - New competitor services with significant advantages
  - Major Appwrite platform changes or limitations
